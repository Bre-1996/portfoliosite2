            <h2>What is a Camera lens?</h2>
			  <br>
            <p>The lens itself is frequently compared to the human eye, as both have the ability to control how much light is allowed through the lens.If you take a look at the anatomical structure of the lens you can clearly see that it is an assembly of convex (curved outward) or concave (curved inward) glass plates. The assembly and shape of each glass plate will determine the setting of each lens and will, in turn, rule out the focal length, aperature and depth of field of the lens.</p>
            <p>Focal Length is the measurement used to determine the distance between the meeting point of the lens and the sensor capturing the image, which is shown in millimeters (mm). The Focal Length varies in range according to which lens is being used, and each millimeter translates how many subjects, objects, or scenes are photographed by your camera.</p>
            <p>Aperture gives you the ability to control how much light in is enters through the lens. Also known as F-Stops, the Aperture works counterintuitively, since the greater the number, the less light is allowed to enter and vice versa. </p>
            <p>Depth of Field is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects/elements that appear in an acceptably sharp photograph.It helps to manipulate the lens' focus between one object and the other before capturing the image.</p>

            <h3 id="standardlenses">Standard Lenses</h3>
            <p> A standard lens has a lens view homogenous to the human eye. Why? It's because the lens can produce photographs with an angle of view very similar to the human eye, this being 50 to 55 degrees diagonally. Also referred to as the Normal lens, it is a coalition of the telephone lens and a wide-angle lens. One of the main features of such a lens is the ability to zoom in and out whilst still keeping the wide-angle view. This lens is best suitable for those who have just started their photography journey, as it is considered the all-rounder lens. The reason being is because it can photograph portraits and landscape images with ease and is both beneficial for indoor and low-light photography </p>

            <h3 id="primelenses">Prime Lenses</h3>
            <p>What's special about the Prime lens is that it has a fixed focal length, although it still does vary between 1 prime lens and the other, generally varying between 35mm and 55mm. Although the prime lens doesn't allow you to zoom in or out, when compared to zoom lenses, the prime lens is to "go-to" lens for many photographers. This is due to their portability perk, as they roughly weigh around 2kg. Another reason why photographers tend to lean towards this lens is its affordability since, compared to its Zoom counterparts, the prime lens will set back roughly around EUR 340, whereas Zoom lenses will set you back to triple that amount or more. Other great attributes that accompany the prime lens is the sharpness of the image produced and the fast aperture they can produce due to their simple structure. </p>

            <h3 id="zoomlenses">Zoom Lenses</h3>
            <p>The Zoom lens is an array of focal lengths in one lens, which you can access by rotating the barrel of the lens. Contrary to the prime lens, the zoom lens can autonomously adjust and reframe to the optimal focal length for the subject at hand, whilst static. This particular lens performs well in low-light conditions, has image stabilization features where you can actually see and feel the lens re-configuring, and is heavy and large in size.</p>

            <h3 id="macrolenses">Macro Lenses</h3>
            <p>The Macro lens is the lens that is mostly adopted for close-up photography since the subject is captured at its real magnitude on the camera's sensor. This means that such a lens can produce an image with incredible detail, more than what the naked eye can comprehend. A macro lens grants the user access to focus from infinity to 1:1 magnification. This means that the size of the subject will be the same as what's captured on the image, so if, for example, a lens is configured to 2:1 maginifation, the object size on the image will be double size of the actual subject, or if, it was adjusted to 5:1 magnifcation, the object will appear fives times its actual size. More often than not, it requires the user to get in close to the subject as it allows for close focusing distances.</p>

            <h3 id="wideanglelense">Wide-angle Lenses</h3>
            <p>The Wide-angle lens gives a wider field of view than the field of view of the naked eye. 
              This allows the photographer to fit more of the scenery into the same frame, or to get closer to the subject without cropping the edges off. Below 50mm of focal length is considered as a wide-angle lens, compared to the standard lens which can reach up to 55mm. This means that the longer the focal length is, the narrower the field of view gets. 
              However, the more the width of the lens increases, the more curvature and distortion the user will witness, at the far edges of the image. This particular lens is ideal for capturing extensive landscapes, restricted interiors, and subjects that wouldn't fit into the field of view of a normal lens, for example, a large building shot at relatively close range. 
              Common focal lengths programmed in a wide-angle lens are 35mm, 28mm, 24mm, 21mm, 17mm, and 14mm. </p>

            <h3 id="specialtylenses">Specialty Lenses</h3>
            <p>Up till now, we have covered some of the basic lenses, however, there is still a vast array of other specialized camera lenses that can help you create a unique outcome for your images. A few of these most prominent lenses are:</p>
            <h4> <a href="https://expertphotography.com/fantastic-fisheye-lens-photography-a-basic-guide/" target="blank">Fisheye Lens</a></h4>
            <p>An ultra-wide-angle lens that can capture a full 180-degree radius around it. Fisheye lenses can distort a photograph's field of view, making a landscape look like a bubble.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://www.the-digital-picture.com/Canon-Lenses/What-Is-a-Tilt-Shift-Lens.aspx" target="blank">Tilt-shift Lens</a></h4>
            <p>A tilt-shift lens, also known as a perspective control lens, distorts perspective as it makes subjects, landscapes, etc look smaller than they are.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://photographylife.com/introduction-to-infrared-photography" target="blank">Infrared Lens</a></h4>
            <p>These Infrared lenses interact with light rather than perspective, disposing of all the light waves except infrared for an idiosyncratic visual effect.</p>

            <h2>Before buying a lens there are a few important factors to consider:</h2>
			  <br>
            <h3>Cost.</h3>
            <p>Lenses can prove to be very costly as some lenses, such as prime and telephoto lenses, can range between EUR 90 and a whopping EUR 4000 so, if you're on a tight budget, consider opting for mid-range zoom lenses that have coverage in the 15-90mm range. This is an "all-rounder" type lens and works well in a variety of situations from portraits to landscapes.</p>
			  <br>
            <h3>Size &#38; Weight.</h3>
            <p>Another important factor to consider is how large and heavy the lens will be. Nowadays, most modern lenses can weigh up to 650 grams, and will probably become heavier as modern technology advances. Keep in mind what the sole purpose of your camera lens is going to be. For example, if you're going on a vacation, opt for a lighter and compact one, but if you're into the wildlife scene, then it's better to opt for a zoom lens.</p>
			  <br>
            <h3>Features.</h3>
            <p>Some lenses have additional features and functionalities which can give you an edge. Many lenses have a built-in auto-focus feature, which helps you stabilize with ease and accurately focus on your subject. Other lenses offer manual focus. This can turn out to be very challenging to use but helps in low light conditions as you can adjust the focus on your own.</p>
